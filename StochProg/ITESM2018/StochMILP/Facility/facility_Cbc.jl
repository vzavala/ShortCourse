## Import Data
customer_matrix = readcsv("Customer.csv");           # Customers information
source_matrix = readcsv("Source.csv");               # Potential sources information
facility_matrix = readcsv("Facilities.csv");         # Data about facilities
demand_matrix = readcsv("Demand.csv");               # Demands in 3 scenarios
probability_matrix = readcsv("Probability.csv");     # Probability of 3 scenarios

## Define Sets
customer = customer_matrix[:,1];                     # Set of custormer nodes
source = source_matrix[:,1];                         # Set of source nodes
facility = facility_matrix[:,1];                     # Set of facilities we can intall
scenario = 1:length(probability_matrix[:,1]);        # Set of scenarios

## Define Normal Dictionaries 
Xc = Dict(zip(customer, customer_matrix[:,2]));      # Match each customer with its location(x,y)[=](km,km)
Yc = Dict(zip(customer, customer_matrix[:,3]));
Xs = Dict(zip(source, source_matrix[:,2]));          # Match each source node with its location(x,y)[=](km,km)
Ys = Dict(zip(source, source_matrix[:,3]));
Cap= Dict(zip(facility, facility_matrix[:,2]));      # Match each facility with its maximum production capacity(tonne/year)
Inv= Dict(zip(facility, facility_matrix[:,3]));      # Match each facility with its investment cost($)
Op = Dict(zip(facility, facility_matrix[:,4]));      # Match each facility with its operational cost($/year)
Pr = Dict(zip(scenario, probability_matrix[:,1]));   # Match each scenario with its probability

## Define Two-key Dictionaries
distance = Dict(("A", "I") => 60.21);                # Distances beween source and customer, the first line is an initiator
for i in source
    for j in customer
       distance[(i, j)] = sqrt((Xs[i]-Xc[j])^2 + (Ys[i]-Yc[j])^2);
    end
end

demand = Dict(("I",1) => 100.5);                     # Demands of customers in each scenario
for j in 1:length(customer)
    for s in scenario
        demand[(customer[j],s)] = demand_matrix[j,s];
    end
end

## Establish Model

@constraint(m, penalty == sum(Pr[s]*40*z[j,s] for j in customer for s in scenario));   
    
# Objective function is to minimize total annual expense
